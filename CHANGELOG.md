[PENDING: Änderung eintragen]

## 1.1
**Updates and your data**
- In-app updates from GitHub Releases: the app checks once a day and shows "Update available" in the bell; one click downloads and installs
- Release signing via `keystore.properties` (see docs/RELEASE.md) so updates install over the old version and keep history, favorites and settings

**Playlists**
- Xtream: if `get.php` fails or returns no playlist (e.g. custom error codes like 884), the app loads the account through `player_api.php` automatically
- Several playlists at the same time: "Also show" in Settings > Playlists; movies and series merged (duplicate movies once, same series as one series with several sources), "Source" filter in Movies/Series, source switch in Live TV
- Stalker/Ministra portals (portal address + MAC): live channels and movies
- M3U file from the device (file picker) or uploaded from the phone page

**Live TV**
- Rewind live TV (optional on-device buffer, 256 MB – 2 GB), pause without missing anything, "Back to live"
- Record the current show (from the buffer, no second connection), storage internal or USB, recordings list in Live TV
- Endless reconnect for live streams, automatic reconnect when the server ends a stream
- New "Sports" section: sports live now and coming up (from the TV guide), all sports channels

**Player**
- MPEG-DASH (.mpd) streams; unsupported formats show a message instead of crashing

**Interface**
- View options moved from the header to Settings > View, with a live preview of card size and artwork
- Sidebar on the left, right or top; icons only or always with text
- Phones: landscape by default, tap for controls, double-tap left/right to skip

**Sports, playlists, second stream**
- Sports hub with filters: sport (football, basketball, tennis, F1, MMA, ...) and time (now, today, tomorrow, next 48 h)
- In the Live TV list you can switch the playlist (or "All playlists") without going into the settings
- Second stream in the live player: picture-in-picture or split screen, sound from either stream, swap streams. Arrangement, window size (4 sizes) and corner are saved (Settings > Player > Second stream)

**Phone search**
- New button at the bottom of the sidebar: shows a QR code. Scan it and search movies, series and live channels on your phone (a web page served by the TV, same Wi-Fi, nothing to install). Tap a result to play it on the TV; pause, skip, stop and volume buttons included

**Languages**
- Dutch (Nederlands) is the 10th language

**Metadata**
- Own API keys for TMDB and OMDb in Settings > API keys
- Without keys: description, cover, rating, genres, running time and trailer straight from the Xtream provider
- OMDb ratings also without TMDB (lookup by title and year)
- Rating order for sorting and "Top rated": IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, TMDB, provider

**Interface (new)**
- Settings > View rebuilt: 5 tabs (cards, sidebar, grid, home, categories) with a live preview of every option
- New "Donate" card in the settings (PayPal link and QR code)

**Transfer**
- Transfer history, favorites and settings to another device over Wi-Fi (optionally with playlists)
- QR codes: scan instead of typing the address (add playlist from phone, Wi-Fi transfer, Google sign-in)
- Settings > About: optional donation link (PayPal) with QR code
- Much faster loading of large Xtream accounts: series episodes are fetched when a series is opened instead of 50,000 requests while loading
- Optional backup to Google Drive (sign-in with a code, see docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE.md)
- Read the last crash report on the phone (no clipboard needed)
